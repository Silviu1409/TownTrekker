# TownTrekker
This repo contains my Bachelor's Thesis (2023) from the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics &amp; Informatics, written in Romanian, whose title is **TownTrekker - social media platform**.

Throughout the paper, I present the development process of this mobile app, in which I used a variety of tools and elements, including:

* a ML model for _Sentiment Analysis_, with the purpose of analyzing user reviews to determine whether their experience was good, bad or neutral
* a graph algorithm (BFS) with set depth, to determine the group of related users in the sphere of the current social media user
* some filtering algorithms, to identify and show posts and recommendations for relevant categories of locations
* an interactive map, where the users can explore their surroundings and discover new places

and many more.
